# My First Website

Hi I'm boblogdev,


This README.md was created to show my capability when using markdown.

Please visit my first real site pushed to [Git Hub Pages](https://boblogdev.github.io/my-full-template/)

## Why push something so small?
---
Pushing something so small and seemingly insignificant is an important step in growth. A few month down the line, I can look at my very first commits and see how far I have progressed.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- GitPod IDE 
- GitPod VSCode Browser
- GitHub
- Git Version Control

**Reminder to myself**

Come back here every so often to evaluate your journey.
